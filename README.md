This project was written in C++. 

Multiple sources were consulted for this project:
- I utilized the starter project at [https://github.com/rob-p/cpp_sa_starter_proj](https://github.com/rob-p/cpp_sa_starter_proj).
- I consulted [https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_files.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_files.asp) for information regarding file input/output in C++.
- For more detailed information about binary files, I consulted [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reading-and-writing-binary-file-in-c-cplusplus](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reading-and-writing-binary-file-in-c-cplusplus).
- I consulted both [https://cplusplus.com/reference/](https://cplusplus.com/reference/) and [https://en.cppreference.com/](https://en.cppreference.com/) for the names and descriptions of various string and file related functions in C++ that I needed to refresh myself on.
- As a refresher on implementing binary search, I referenced [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/).
- For general troubleshooting or "quick" implementation questions such as "Passing unique_ptr<int[]> to a function", I utilized [https://stackoverflow.com/](https://stackoverflow.com/).
